    <h1>The Learn Enough story</h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding.this including from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts, googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong><em>at least 1,000,000,000 people </em></strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners_Lee">Tim Berners Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

     <Strong>Quotations</Strong>

     <p>
       In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:

     <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #FILL_IN;">
       <p>
          <em> Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
          <br>
          -Abraham Lincoln
        </p>

      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front end development, or writing some of the interface related learn enough tutorials.

     You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or the Ellen show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well spec'd  lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
